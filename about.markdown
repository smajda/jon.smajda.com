I'm a graduate student in sociology, but this isn't really a "sociology blog". I do occasionally write about my research (currently on politics and technology). 

I'm also a longtime Mac fanboy, a recently converted Unix nerd, and an amateur programmer, so I write a lot about little tips and tricks as I learn them. I manage a [fairly large WordPress blog][cxt] and am most familiar with PHP, but I'm currently learning Ruby and toying around with Objective-C, so that should give you an idea of what you can expect.

I also love music and have been playing the guitar since I was a eight, so I write about music quite a bit too.

I used to post here more frequently, but I've decided I like having separate places for *writing* (which I do here) and for *sharing stuff*, which I now do [on Tumblr][tumblr]. I'm also [on Twitter][twitter], if you want to count that as blogging.

This blog runs on [Jekyll][], which is the fourth blogging platform I've used. I started blogging with a Mac application called [iBlog][], moved to Blogger for awhile, and then from May 2005 to October 2009, I ran a self-hosted WordPress blog. Some posts from all of these blogs survive here, though I deleted the vast majority of them. They were pretty awful. I sincerely apologize to my early readers.
